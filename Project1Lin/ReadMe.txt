Whenever a text file is created by submitting the form on GUI the text are not readable, 
and the file gets rewritten every time the App restarts.
Also I couldn't figure out how the courses work with course TOOK, TOTAKE , and TAKING in GUI, 
and the Find button under the MenuItem Search didn't work as well. 


The TextInputDialog won't show up when user inputs the wrong data.
